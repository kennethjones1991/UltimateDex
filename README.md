# UltimateDex
The ultimate Pok√©dex app containing sprites, descriptions, maps, and location data for all generations of Pok√©mon.

## Why?
I'm building this app because I love Pok√©mon and have been playing since the original games came out all those years ago. I want to bring back those memories and help new players create new memories with the old games as well as the newer ones.

## Tech Stack
Another purpose for building this app is to test myself in some core concepts and technologies for creating iOS apps.

The design pattern and frameworks I will use to build this app are:
- MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
- SwiftUI
- Core Data

## Latest Update - Wednesday, March 30, 2022
Since this is also the first update, I'll talk about my progress up to this point.

I've already decided the overall content that I want to include in my app, which as you can see from the progress reports above, includes a comprehensive Pok√©dex for all generations as well as a MoveDex, MapDex, and game walkthroughs. I also mention app themes and app screens.

App themes are going to be unrelated to the functionality or content of the app; they will just be like skins you can apply to make your app look how you want. They will be included to help support the future development of this project.

App screens are just any screen that doesn't really have anything to do with the Pok√©dex content, such as the Settings screen, the Credits screen, and any other screens that need to be there but aren't really Pok√©dex stuff.

I use the app Mockup on the iPad to do very rough designs of my screens, and I've designed 3 screens so far, which you can view below.

![Default Pok√©dex Screen](/images/defaultpokedexscreen.PNG)
This is a pretty simple screen that just shows all the Pok√©mon in a classic iOS list style. Each list item has the Pok√©mon's sprite as well as name and types. You can tap on any Pok√©mon to go to a detail screen.

![Evolution Pok√©dex Screen](/images/evolutionpokedexscreen.PNG)
This is another version of the above screen, but it shows the Pok√©mon in their evolutionary chains, as well as the level they normally evolve at. You can still tap on any Pok√©mon to go to its detail screen.

![Pok√©mon Detail Screen](/images/pokemondetailscreen.png)
This screen shows up when you tap on a Pok√©mon from the previous Pok√©dex screens. It shows all the information about the Pok√©mon, such as the sprite, game description, stats, evolutions, and moves. You can also switch between viewing the grayscale sprite or the color sprite, and you can play the Pok√©mon's cry. Tapping on the sprite will bring up a sprite screen where you can see both the front and back of the Pok√©mon. And tapping on the View Map button in the How To Get section brings up a map of the region with the Pok√©mon's locations labeled.

## Next Steps
- Finish Pok√©dex screen designs
    - Sprite screen
    - View Map screen
- Design Walkthrough screens
